			<h4> About Austin:
			</h4>
			<p> 
				Born and raised in the Salt Lake Valley, there are few places that Austin would rather be than Northern Utah. He also has an appreciation for the beautiful weather of Southern California, serving there for two years as a missionary in the greater Long Beach, California area. While working as a missionary, Austin learned Spanish, and developed a love for Latin language and culture, including food.  There are few things he enjoys more than a good taco.
			</p>
			<p>
				Austin has attended school at Brigham Young University - Idaho.  He had been pursing a Bachelorâ€™s in Political Science when he discovered his love for coding.  He will be earning his Associate's Degree from BYU - Idaho in July 2014, after which he will pursue a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Utah beginning Fall 2014. He is passionate about web design and programming, and technology in general, and is an avid follower of current events and politics. Though he has a wide variety of interests and hobbies, his favorite activity is spending time with his beautiful wife and daughter.  The Hesterly Family is excited to welcome another baby girl into their family in September of this year.

			<h4> About Austin:
			</h4>
			<p> Born and raised in the Salt Lake Valley, there are few places that he is quite as home at than Northern Utah.  He also has an appreciation for the beautiful weather of Southern California, having volunteered for two years as a missionary for his church in Long Beach, California and surrounding areas.  While working as a missionary, Austin learned Spanish, and developed a love for Latin language and culture. Austin has attended school at Brigham Young University - Idaho, where he will be earning his Associate's Degree in July 2014. He will be pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Utah beginning Fall 2014. He is passionate about web design and programming, and computers in general, and is an avid follower of current events and politics. Always a team player, Austin enjoys helping those around him succeed in their endeavors, along with finding success in his own pursuits.
